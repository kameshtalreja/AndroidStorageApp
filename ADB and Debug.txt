Android Debug Bridge
The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command-line tool that facilitates communication between a computer and an
Android device or emulator. It is a part of the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) and is used by developers
for various tasks related to Android app development and device management. Here's a simple explanation of what
ADB does:

Communication : ADB allows your computer to communicate with an Android device or emulator over a USB connection
or, in some cases, over a Wi-Fi network.

Commands : Developers can use ADB commands to perform various actions on the connected Android device. These
actions include installing and uninstalling apps, copying files between the computer and the device, capturing
screenshots, rebooting the device, and more.

Debugging : ADB is particularly useful for debugging Android apps. Developers can use it to access the device's
log files, run commands on the device, and troubleshoot issues during the development process.

Development : ADB is an essential tool for Android app developers as it provides a way to interact with the device
directly from the command line, enabling efficient testing and debugging of applications.

adb devices: Lists all connected Android devices.
adb install <path_to_apk>: Installs an Android app on the connected device.
adb uninstall <package_name>: Uninstalls an app from the device.
adb shell: Opens a shell on the device, allowing you to execute commands directly.
