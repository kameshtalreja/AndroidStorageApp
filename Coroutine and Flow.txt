Coroutine :
a coroutine is concurrency design pattern that you can use on android to simplify the code that
execute asynchronously.
-> help to run long running task that might be block main thread and cause to you app to become unresponsive

recommended for asynchronously

-> Lightweight : You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which
doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while
supporting many concurrent operations.

-> Fewer Memory leaks
-> Jetpack integration : some libraries also provide own coroutine scopes that you can use for structured concurrency.
