Hoisting In Compose : hoisting refers to the practice of moving the management of state or behavior from a child composable to a parent composable. This is
done to make the child composable more reusable and configurable by allowing the parent to control and provide necessary data or callbacks. Hoisting helps in creating
composable functions that are more flexible and can be used in different contexts by lifting the responsibility of certain aspects, like state handling, to higher levels
in the composable hierarchy.
