what is difference between @binds and @provides ?

@bind tell dagger to understand the relationship between the interface/abstract and it's implementation, while
@provide tells dagger how to create and provide  instance of a particular class. they are both tools in dagger for
managing dependency injection.

provide
-it used to define methods within a dagger module that provide instances of objects.
it's used when you want to explicitly specify how to create and provide instance of particular type.
