inline Function: An inline function is a function that, during compilation, is expanded in place at the call site, rather than being called as a regular function.
This can lead to performance improvements by avoiding the overhead of function calls.

Higher Order Function : a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as parameters or returns a function. This concept is a fundamental
part of functional programming and allows you to treat functions as first-class citizens in the language. Higher-order functions can be used to create more abstract and
reusable code.


Scope Function : Scope functions are functions in the Kotlin standard library whose purpose is to execute a block of code within the context of an object. It provides
a temporary scope when you call the function on the object with a lambda expression. In this scope, the function can access the object without its name. There are
five scope functions.
