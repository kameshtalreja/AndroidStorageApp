-> SOlID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles in Object-Oriented software development intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. These five principles are described by Robert C. Martin. SOLID principles are briefly as follows:

1. Single Responsibility Principle
each class should focus on doing one thing and doing it well.


2. Open Closed Principle
The Open-Closed Principle suggests that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. In Android, this means you should be able to add new features without changing existing code.


3. Liskov's Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
