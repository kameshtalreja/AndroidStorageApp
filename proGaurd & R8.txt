Both ProGaurd and R8 are tools to optimize and obfuscate the code.

Optimize : is remote all the unused Classes, Functions and field of project and also from the libraries
which has been used in project.
Obfuscate : means is this tool wil change the names of all the classes, functions and fields of the project.

how to enable it ?
     isMinifyEnabled = true
you need to set the true of minifyEnabled field. it will optimize the code.


how to optimize the Resources ?
    shrinkResources = true
you need to set the true of shrinkResources field.

how to ignore the obfuscation on file ?
you can use @keep annotation before the class name.

how to set the rules in proGaurd file ?

-keep class com.kamesh.pkg.data.*
you can keep all the classes of package or one

-keep class com.kamesh.pkg.data.* { funcation/class }
under brackets those functions and class we declare will not be obfuscate.


how to check the original name of obfuscated class in android ?
we have a map file of those classes in app/build/outputs/mapping/release or debug/mapping.txt
this help us in case if we face a crash on production app.
