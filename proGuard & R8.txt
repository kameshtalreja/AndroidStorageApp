Both Proguard and R8 are tools to optimize and obfuscate the code.

Optimize : is remove all the unused Classes, Functions and field of project and also from the libraries
which has been used in project.
Obfuscate : mean's is this tool will change the names of all the classes, functions and fields of the project.

how to enable it ?
     isMinifyEnabled = true
you need to set the true to the value of minifyEnabled field. it will optimize the code.

how to optimize the Resources ?
    shrinkResources = true
you need to set the true of the value of shrinkResources field.

how to ignore the obfuscation on single file ?
you can use @keep annotation before the class name.

how to set the rules in proGaurd file ?

open the file : app/proguard-rules.pro

-keep class com.kamesh.pkg.data.*
you can keep all the classes of package or single class

-keep class com.kamesh.pkg.data.* { function/class }
under brackets those functions and class we declare will not be obfuscate.


how to check the original name of obfuscated class in android ?
we have a map file of those classes in app/build/outputs/mapping/release or debug/mapping.txt
this help us in case if we face a crash on production app.

what is difference between apk file and bundle ?

App bundles are the publishing format and APK (Android application package) is the packaging format
which eventually will be install on device.
  google uses app bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs for each user's device configuration, so they
download only the code resources they need to run the app. therefore user can get smaller and more optimized downloads.
